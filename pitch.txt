Chapters is a unique data collection tool, never before seen in industry. 

It's essentially an exclusive library of text-based adventure games. You beat a game, you get paid.

Anyone can jump on Chapters for free, you just need the daily password to get into the site.

It's also a tool for amateur authors to improve their story-telling skills and improve their chance of getting published.

Two part business plan: Subscription based plans for those just playing the games, and the amateur authors paying for the service. Or you can pay for each game.... with no subscription




Benefit of the subscription plan - you get to play all the games in the library. Those who don't have the subscription plan can only play 2 or 3 games in the library.
